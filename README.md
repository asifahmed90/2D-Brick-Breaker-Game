# 2D-Brick-Breaker-Game
A simple 2D Brick Breaker Game in Java. I used Java Swing to implement the game and will work with Java FX in future to implement better version of it. The bar can be implemented using mouse but to keep the matter simple I used right and left key to move the bar.  I tried to implement the game the simplest way possible according to the user input.

###Here is the interface of the game.
